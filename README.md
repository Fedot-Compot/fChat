# fChat

**fChat** is a fork of **fChat** an overlay that allows you to show your Twitch chat on screen with OBS, XSplit, and any other streaming software that supports browser sources.

It supports your [**BetterTTV**](https://betterttv.com/), [**FrankerFaceZ**](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) and [**7TV**](https://7tv.app/) emotes, always at the best available quality.
